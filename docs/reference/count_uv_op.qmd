```{julia}
#| eval: false
count_uv_op(ts; op_length::Int=3, d=1)

```

Count the number of ordinal patterns in bins for a single time series `ts`. 
 
  * `ts::Vector{Float64}`: Time series for which the ordinal patterns are counted.
  * `op_length::Int=3`: Length of the ordinal patterns. Default is 3. Minimum is 2, maximum is 4.
  * `d::Int=1`: Time delay. Default is 1.

```{julia}
#| eval: false

ts = rand(100)
count_uv_op(ts; op_length=3, d=1)

```
