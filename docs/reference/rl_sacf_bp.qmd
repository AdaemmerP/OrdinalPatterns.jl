Compute the out-of-control run length using the spatial autocorrelation function  (SACF) for the BP-statistic. The function returns the run length for a given control    limit `cl` and a given number of repetitions `reps`. The input arguments are:
 
  * `lam`: The smoothing parameter for the exponentially weighted moving average
(EWMA) control chart.
 
  * `cl`: The control limit for the EWMA control chart.
  * `w::Int`: The window size for the BP-statistic.'
  * `p_reps::UnitRange`: The number of repetitions to compute the run length. This
has to be a unit range of integers to allow for parallel processing, since the function    is called by `arl_sacf()`.
 
  * `spatial_dgp::SpatialDGP`: The spatial data generating process (DGP) to use for
the SACF function. This can be one of the following: `SAR1`, `SAR11`, `SAR22`,    `SINAR11`, `SQMA11`, `SQINMA11`, or `BSQMA11`.
 
  * `dist_error::UnivariateDistribution`: The distribution to use for the error
term in the spatial process. This can be any univariate distribution from the  `Distributions.jl` package.
 
  * `dist_ao::Union{UnivariateDistribution,Nothing}`: The distribution to use for
the additive outlier term in the spatial process. This can be any univariate , distribution from the `Distributions.jl` package or `Nothing`.
