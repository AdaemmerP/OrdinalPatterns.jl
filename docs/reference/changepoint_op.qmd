::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="docblock" collapse=false}    


```{julia}
#| eval: false
changepoint_op(tsx, tsy; conf_level=0.95, weight=true, bn=log(length(tsx)), op_length::Int=3, d=1)

```

Compute the changepoint in dependence between two time series based on Schnurr and Dehling (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1164706>.
 
  * `tsx`: First time series for which the ordinal patterns are counted.
  * `tsy`: Second time series for which the ordinal patterns are counted.
  * `conf_level::Float64=0.95`: Confidence level for the changepoint detection. Default is 0.95.
  * `weight::Bool=true`: Whether to use a weight function. Default is true.
  * `bn::Float64=log(length(tsx))`: Bandwidth for the kernel function. Default is log(length(tsx)).
  * `op_length::Int=3`: Length of the ordinal patterns. Default is 3. Minimum is 2, maximum is 4.
  * `d::Int=1`: Time delay. Default is 1.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
tsx = rand(100)
tsy = rand(100)
changepoint_op(tsx, tsy; conf_level=0.95, weight=true, bn=log(length(tsx)), op_length=3, d=1)

```
