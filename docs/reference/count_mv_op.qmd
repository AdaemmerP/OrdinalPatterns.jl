```{julia}
#| eval: false
count_mv_op(tsx, tsy; op_length::Int=3, d=1)

```

Count the number of ordinal patterns in bins for two time series `tsx` and `tsy`. The output will be used to compute the ordinal pattern dependence coefficient by Schnurr and Dehling (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1164706>.
 
  * `tsx`: First time series for which the ordinal patterns are counted.
  * `tsy`: Second time series for which the ordinal patterns are counted.
  * `op_length::Int=3`: Length of the ordinal patterns. Default is 3. Minimum is 2, maximum is 4.
  * `d::Int=1`: Time delay. Default is 1.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
tsx = rand(100)
tsy = rand(100)
count_mv_op(tsx, tsy; op_length=3, d=1)

```
