```{julia}
#| eval: false
rl_sacf(m::Int, n::Int, lam, cl, p_reps, dist_error)

```

Compute the in-control run length (RL) using the spatial autocorrelation function (SACF) for a lag length of 1. The function returns the RL for a given control limit `cl` and a given number of repetitions `p_reps`. The input arguments are:   
 
  * `m::Int`: The number of rows in the matrix for the SOP matrix. Note that the original matrix will have dimensions (m + 1) x (n + 1).
  * `n::Int`: The number of columns in the matrix for the SOP matrix. Note that the original matrix will have dimensions (m + 1) x (n + 1).
  * `lam`: The smoothing parameter for the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart.
  * `cl`: The control limit for the EWMA control chart.
  * `p_reps`: The number of repetitions to compute the RL. This has to be a unit range of integers to allow for parallel processing, since the function is called by `arl_sacf()`.
  * `dist_error`: The distribution to use for the error term in the SACF function.

```{julia-repl}
#| eval: false
#--- Example
# Set parameters
m = 10
n = 10
lam = 0.1
cl = .001
p_reps = 1:10
dist_error = Normal(0, 1)

# Compute run length
rls = rl_sacf(m, n, lam, cl, p_reps, dist_error)

```

#| eval: false
rl_sacf(m::Int, n::Int, lam, cl, p_reps::UnitRange, spatial_dgp, dist_error::UnivariateDistribution, dist_ao::Union{UnivariateDistribution, Nothing})

```

Compute the out-of-control run length (RL) using the spatial autocorrelation function (SACF) for a lag length of 1. The function returns the RL for a given control limit `cl` and a given number of repetitions `p_reps`. The input arguments are:  
 
  * `m::Int`: The number of rows in the matrix for the SOP matrix. Note that the original matrix will have dimensions (m + 1) x (n + 1).
  * `n::Int`: The number of columns in the matrix for the SOP matrix. Note that the original matrix will have dimensions (m + 1) x (n + 1).
  * `lam`: The smoothing parameter for the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart.
  * `cl`: The control limit for the EWMA control chart.
  * `p_reps`: The number of repetitions to compute the RL. This has to be a unit range of integers to allow for parallel processing, since the function is called by `arl_sacf()`.
  * `spatial_dgp`: The spatial data generating process (DGP) to use for the SACF function. This can be one of the following: `SAR1`, `SAR11`, `SINAR11`, `SQMA11`, `SQINMA11`, or `BSQMA11`.
  * `dist_error`: The distribution to use for the error term in the SACF function. This can be any univariate distribution from the `Distributions.jl` package with a defined mean or a custom distribution.
  * `dist_ao`: The distribution to use for for additive outliers. This can be any univariate distribution from the `Distributions.jl` package or a custom distribution.
